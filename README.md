### Overview and Origin
One of the many challenges that impact the Financial Services industry is attending the people at the bottom of the pyramid, the largest and poorest socio-economic group which is usually left out of the Financial System due to lack of options in the market. That issue has been acknowledged and understood by disrupted companies like Aura (formerly known as Insikt), leading to innovation to help people who usually are rejected by the traditional banks by making accessible small loans and building their credit history. 
<br  ><br  />
Aura was founded by James Gutierrez, Kevin Kang, Randal Wong, all three founders helped create and scale Oportun, a company that offers microloans to primarily unserved Hispanic people in the U.S. In 2012 Aura was founded as Insikt, they launched his product Lendify in 2014. The company was created with the idea of attending underbanked people who usually do not have access to the traditional financial services and more than often access to non-formal and expensive options or predatory lenders like the payday loan industry. 
<br  ><br  />
The idea behind Aura and its services is related to financially underserved people. Aura noticed the need of his Hispanic immigrants to access financial services, more specifically, access to loans to achieve their goals in the U.S. Usually these people work long hours, often at multiple jobs but they cannot access traditional banks as they often have no credit history. They also noticed how the cashier check companies, remittances companies, and small businesses have access to a large database of customers that require financial services but they do not have the infrastructure required to offer those services. That is how Aura created the formerly known Lendify product, which offers lending as a service; this product allows small businesses to offer loans to its customers through Aura. Aura has raised a total of $584.7M in funding over 15 rounds. Their latest funding was raised on Mar 5, 2020, from a Debt Financing round.

## Business Activities:
Usually, microloans have two main purposes. One is helping the people at the bottom of the pyramid to start small businesses. The second purpose is to lend to people who cannot obtain credit from traditional banks due to lack of credit history or requiring small amounts of money that are below the amounts required by a bank. Aura is attending the second purpose of the microloans by providing software to businesses that allow them to offer small loans to their consumers. The businesses provide the customers and Aura handles the details of actually providing the loans. This service helps consumers with low credit scores or no credit history at all to get an installment loan and start building their credit history. 
Peer-to-peer platforms such as Lending Club and Prosper are two companies that administer microlending for people trying to build a credit history. Their platforms connect the borrowers with potential borrowers. A borrower may seek funding for any number of reasons, which are made explicit to potential lenders. If the lender does not trust the borrower they will elect not to fund that particular loan. In some cases, loans may not be fully funded because they cannot attract enough lenders to contribute.

Aura's website describes the company as a technology-powered, Community Development Financial Institution that provides fair, affordable loans to working families in America. Aura's mission is to build financially healthy low-income communities, by providing empowering financial services to underbanked and unbanked. Aura uses its proprietary scoring algorithms to review and approve credit applications and offers free credit scores and personalized expense management guidance to borrowers, allowing the working population to access loans in a simplified manner. Aura has pioneered a cloud-based lending technology that enables trusted local businesses to submit credit applications for centralized review and approval by its proprietary scoring algorithms. Aura is currently available in nearly 1,200 locations across California, Texas, Illinois, and Arizona.

### Landscape:
Due to the inherent risk attached to microloans, these are usually issued by individuals rather than banks or credit unions. In other words, most microloans are peer to peer in the purest sense as lenders invest only a small amount per loan but fund a portfolio of multiple microloans. Therefore, any individual borrower may find their loan is funded by a large number of lenders, each contributing a small percentage of the total amount. This allows them to spread the risk across multiple loans with different credit qualities and other attributes, lenders can ensure that even if one or two loans default, their portfolios will not be wiped out. Usually microloans have a higher risk than other loans due to the lack of credit history of the borrowers, for that reason microloans offer above-market interest rates.

## Recommendations
It would be a great business opportunity to offer banking as a service. Using the same concept applied to the lending product but offering a checking/savings account. This product can help to make banking accessible to vulnerable groups. They can use an API (Application Programming Interface) like Galileo which is already being used by companies like Chime, Varo, and others.
